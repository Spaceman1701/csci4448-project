# CSCI 4448 Project

My code is in 3 seperate respositories. Each of these repositories is a distinct part of the project. [Documentation](https://spaceman1701.github.io/csci4448-project/)


For the final report version of this repository I have added submodules that reference to the final report version of each subproject. These submodules are the `lighter @ b7775f4` and `cafe.connor.fun-backend @ 2a23920` directories shown on github. Clicking either of those directories will navigate you to the appropriate commit in the root repository of that project.
